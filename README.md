# CODE Sherpa

**Theme:** Open Innovation  
**Project Nature:** *AI-assisted Web-based Developer Tool*

## Problem Statement

Developers frequently struggle to understand large or unfamiliar codebases when joining new projects. Existing approaches rely on static documentation, informal knowledge transfer, or ad-hoc assistance, which fail to clearly explain **code flow**, **inter-file dependencies**, and **underlying design decisions**. As a result, onboarding time increases, errors become more frequent, and developers often hesitate to modify critical parts of the system.

---

## Background & Motivation

- Modern software projects grow rapidly in size and complexity, while documentation often becomes outdated or incomplete.  
- New contributors spend a significant portion of their time navigating unfamiliar files, tracing execution paths, and understanding implicit dependencies across the codebase.

- Although tools exist for code navigation, search, and autocomplete, they primarily support **writing new code** rather than **learning an existing system**.  
- This creates a gap where developers rely on trial-and-error and repeated context switching, slowing productivity and contributing to long-term technical debt.

---

## Research & Observations

Research across academia, industry, and developer communities consistently indicates that **understanding existing codebases** is a major challenge in software engineering.

**Key findings from prior work and observations include:**

- **Program comprehension studies** show that developers spend a significant portion of their time reading and understanding existing code rather than writing new functionality, especially during maintenance and onboarding phases.  
  *Program Comprehension – IEEE*  
  https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8468136

- **Developer onboarding research** highlights that new contributors often struggle to build a *system-level mental model* due to implicit design decisions, missing architectural context, and reliance on informal knowledge transfer.  
  *Developer Onboarding – ACM*  
  https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3196398.3196400

- **Industry productivity reports** frequently identify code comprehension, legacy systems, and onboarding as major bottlenecks, with a substantial share of engineering time spent navigating and tracing existing code rather than implementing new features.  
  *Engineering Productivity – InfoQ*

- **Community discussions** on platforms such as Reddit and X further reinforce that this difficulty persists across experience levels. Developers often report being able to complete isolated tasks while lacking confidence to modify critical or interconnected parts of a system, even after extended exposure.

Together, these signals suggest that the challenge of understanding codebases is **systemic rather than a skill deficiency**, and that existing tools do not adequately support **structured learning** of complex software systems.

## Proposed Solution

CODE Sherpa is designed as a **guided learning system** that helps developers understand unfamiliar codebases in a structured and progressive manner. Instead of relying on static documentation or reactive question-answering, the system proactively walks a user through key parts of a project, explaining how components are organized, how control flows through the code, and why certain design decisions exist.

The solution analyzes an existing repository to identify important files, modules, and relationships, and then generates an **interactive learning path** tailored to the codebase. Developers can follow this path step-by-step, receiving concise explanations and contextual guidance while navigating the actual source code.

By focusing on **guided exploration** rather than isolated answers, CODE Sherpa aims to reduce onboarding time, lower cognitive load, and increase developer confidence when working with complex or legacy systems.

---

## Existing Approaches and Identified Gaps

Several tools exist to help developers work with unfamiliar codebases, but they address only isolated aspects of the problem and do not provide **structured understanding**.

- **Static documentation (README files, wikis)** focuses on setup and surface-level usage. These documents quickly become outdated and rarely explain internal logic, design rationale, or runtime behavior.

- **IDE navigation tools** (search, go-to-definition, call hierarchies) help locate code elements but require developers to manually explore and infer relationships. They support navigation, not guided comprehension.

- **AI-assisted chat and coding tools** provide reactive explanations based on user queries. While helpful, they depend on the user already knowing what to ask and typically produce fragmented, context-limited insights rather than a holistic view of the system.

Overall, existing approaches emphasize *access to information* rather than *learning the codebase*. Developers are left to build understanding through trial-and-error and informal knowledge transfer, which is inefficient during onboarding and when dealing with complex or legacy systems.

This gap motivates the need for a **proactive, step-by-step mechanism** that can guide developers through a codebase and help them form an accurate mental model of how it works.

## Prototype Overview

The CODE Sherpa prototype demonstrates an **end-to-end workflow** for transforming an unfamiliar software repository into a structured, interactive learning experience for developers.

At a high level, the prototype:
- Analyzes a codebase to identify important code segments.
- Generates concise explanations and learning checkpoints for those segments.
- Presents them as a guided, step-by-step learning flow directly alongside the source code.

The objective of the prototype is to show how code comprehension can move from an *ad-hoc, manual activity* to a *structured and repeatable learning process*.

---

## Conceptual Workflow

The prototype operates as a simple **three-stage pipeline**:

1. **Code Analysis**  
   The repository is scanned to identify key files, entry points, and logical code segments, along with their precise locations in the source code.

2. **Guided Tour Generation**  
   Identified code segments are processed to produce grounded explanations and lightweight comprehension checks, which are assembled into an ordered learning sequence.

3. **Interactive Learning Experience**  
   The learning sequence guides developers through the codebase step-by-step, opening relevant files, highlighting important sections, and presenting explanations as the user progresses.

---

## Current Implementation Scope

The current prototype focuses on validating the **core learning experience** and **interaction flow**.

**Implemented capabilities include:**
- Repository analysis for small to medium-sized projects.
- Automatic identification of key code segments with line-level precision.
- Generation of code-grounded explanations and simple comprehension checks.
- An interactive guided walkthrough that progresses step-by-step through the codebase.
- Local execution with support for pre-generated walkthroughs to enable reliable demos.

**Intentionally out of scope for the current prototype:**
- Multi-language support.
- Large-scale or monorepo handling.
- Collaboration features and analytics.
- Advanced architectural inference or design-pattern detection.

---

## Prototype Significance

This prototype demonstrates that **meaningful, code-grounded learning experiences** can be generated automatically and delivered through a guided workflow. It validates the feasibility of CODE Sherpa’s core idea and establishes a foundation for extending the system toward larger codebases and richer learning paths.

## System Overview

The CODE Sherpa system operates as a guided learning pipeline that transforms a software repository into an interactive code understanding experience:

1. **Input** – A source code repository is provided as the learning target.  
2. **Repository Analysis** – The system scans the codebase to identify key files, entry points, and meaningful code segments.  
3. **Structure Interpretation** – Relationships between identified segments are inferred to form a coherent learning sequence.  
4. **Learning Path Generation** – A step-by-step walkthrough is constructed to introduce the codebase progressively.  
5. **Contextual Guidance** – Explanations and learning prompts are presented alongside the relevant code at each step.  
6. **User Progression** – Developers move through the learning path at their own pace, building a system-level understanding.

This workflow emphasizes **structured comprehension** over ad-hoc exploration.
