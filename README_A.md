## 1. Architectural Overview

CODE_Sherpa follows a **modular, pipeline-oriented architecture** that clearly separates deterministic code analysis from AI-assisted explanation and presentation layers. This separation ensures predictable behavior, improves explainability, and allows individual components to evolve independently.
> AI-assisted explanation and editor integration are intentionally deferred to Round-2 and operate only on verified structure.


### Key Design Principles:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Deterministic analysis is isolated from AI-driven explanation generation
- **Controlled AI Usage**: AI is applied only after deterministic structure extraction, never as a source of truth
- **Explicit Data Flow**: Clear boundaries and data contracts between pipeline stages
- **Modularity**: Components can be developed, tested, and replaced independently
- **Extensibility**: Architecture supports incremental enhancement without redesign

The system is designed with clear boundaries, controlled AI usage, and explicit data flow between stages, ensuring reliability and maintainability.

## 2. High-Level System Architecture

The system consists of **five loosely coupled layers**, each with distinct responsibilities:

### 2.1 Repository Ingestion
**Purpose**: Accepts a repository and prepares a structured file layout for analysis.

**Responsibilities**:
- File system traversal and discovery
- Filtering and normalization of source files
- Exclusion of non-source directories (build artifacts, dependencies, etc.)
- Preparation of file metadata and structure

### 2.2 Static Code Analysis
**Purpose**: Extracts code structure, dependencies, and relationships without execution.

**Responsibilities**:
- Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing
- Symbol extraction (functions, classes, imports)
- Dependency graph construction
- Entry point identification
- Call relationship mapping

### 2.3 Context Grounding
**Purpose**: Converts analysis results into structured semantic context for explanation.

**Responsibilities**:
- Transformation of raw analysis data into semantic representations
- Identification of important code segments and patterns
- Relationship mapping between components
- Preparation of context for explanation generation

### 2.4 Explanation Engine
**Purpose**: Generates guided, human-readable explanations from grounded context.

**Responsibilities**:
- AI-assisted explanation generation
- Learning path construction
- Step-by-step tour creation
- Comprehension checkpoint generation
- Contextual guidance production

### 2.5 Developer Interface
**Purpose**: Displays interactive walkthroughs within the developer workflow.

**Responsibilities**:
- File navigation and code highlighting
- Explanation presentation
- Progress tracking
- User interaction handling
- Integration with development environments

## 3. System Workflow (End to End)

The complete workflow transforms a raw repository into an interactive learning experience:

1. **Repository Submission**: Developer provides a source code repository as input
2. **Structure Ingestion**: Repository structure is ingested and normalized for processing
3. **Static Analysis**: Code structure, dependencies, and relationships are extracted
4. **Context Construction**: Grounded context is built from analysis artifacts
5. **Explanation Generation**: AI generates step-by-step explanations and guided tours
6. **Interface Presentation**: Results are presented through an interactive developer interface

## 4. Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)

### 4.1 DFD Level 0 (Context Diagram)

The highest-level view showing the system boundary:

- **External Entity**: Developer
- **System**: CODE_Sherpa
- **Input**: Source code repository
- **Output**: Structured explanations and guided tours

The developer provides a repository to CODE_Sherpa and receives structured explanations in return. Internal processing is abstracted to define clear system boundaries.

### 4.2 DFD Level 1 (First Decomposition)

Shows the major processes within the system:

- **Process 1**: Repository Ingestion
- **Process 2**: Static Code Analysis
- **Process 3**: Context Grounding
- **Process 4**: Explanation Generation
- **Process 5**: Interface Rendering

Source code flows through ingestion, analysis, context grounding, and explanation generation stages, producing intermediate artifacts that are progressively refined into human-readable guidance.

## 5. Component-Level Architecture

Each major component has well-defined responsibilities:

### 5.1 Repository Ingestion
Accepts and structures repositories, handling file system operations and filtering.

### 5.2 Static Analysis
Extracts syntax, dependencies, and symbols using AST parsing and static analysis techniques.

### 5.3 Context Grounding
Converts analysis results into semantic context, identifying patterns and relationships.

### 5.4 Explanation Engine
Generates guided walkthroughs using AI, creating step-by-step learning paths with explanations.

### 5.5 Developer Interface
Displays explanations interactively, providing file navigation, code highlighting, and progress tracking.

## 6. Interaction / Sequence Flow

A guided walkthrough follows this sequence:

1. **Developer Request**: Developer initiates a learning session for a repository
2. **Orchestration**: The orchestration layer coordinates analysis and context preparation
3. **Analysis Execution**: Static analysis components extract code structure
4. **Context Preparation**: Analysis results are transformed into semantic context
5. **Explanation Invocation**: Explanation engine generates guided content
6. **Response Delivery**: Generated content is returned to the interface
7. **Presentation**: Interface displays explanations and guides user interaction

The flow ensures ordered execution and minimal coupling between components, maintaining a controlled request–response pattern.
