# CODE Sherpa  
## Round-1 Implementation Summary & Round-2 Improvement Plan

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document outlines:

- What was **actually implemented and delivered in Round-1**
- What will be **extended and improved in Round-2**

The intent is to clearly communicate execution progress and planned evolution, without overstating features or scope.

---

## Project Recap (Brief)

CODE Sherpa is a developer-onboarding tool that helps developers understand unfamiliar codebases through a **guided learning experience**.

Rather than relying on documentation, guesswork, or ad-hoc exploration, CODE Sherpa:
- Extracts **verified structural facts** directly from the codebase
- Converts these facts into **step-by-step guided explanations**
- Generates a **visual flowchart** that presents the repository as a coherent system

The goal is to help developers form an accurate mental model of a project before modifying or extending it.

---

## Round-1 Goal

> Validate that a repository can be **understood, explained, and visualized automatically** using deterministic static analysis — without manual documentation or AI-based guessing.

---

## Round-1 Implementation Summary

For the first round of the hackathon, we implemented a **fully working end-to-end prototype** that demonstrates how a codebase can be automatically analyzed and explained using deterministic static analysis.

In Round-1, CODE Sherpa is capable of:
- Analyzing a real repository to extract verified structural facts
- Identifying important files, functions, and call relationships
- Converting this structure into a step-by-step guided explanation
- Generating a flowchart that visually represents overall code flow and dependencies

The Round-1 implementation prioritizes **correctness, clarity, and reproducibility**, establishing a strong and defensible technical foundation for further enhancements in the final round.

---

## Round-2 Implementation Plan

In the second round, we will build upon the validated Round-1 foundation to improve **intelligence, usability, and real-world developer experience**.

The focus of Round-2 is to transform the current prototype into a more interactive and practical onboarding tool by introducing:

- **AI-assisted explanations**, generated **only after** verified code structure has been extracted
- Deeper and clearer guided explanations with an improved learning order
- Short **comprehension questions** to reinforce user understanding
- Integration with **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** to deliver guided tours directly inside the developer’s editor
- Automatic file navigation and line-level code highlighting within VS Code
- Improved visualizations for clearer understanding of system flow and dependencies

All Round-2 enhancements extend the existing pipeline while preserving its core principle:  
**every explanation must be grounded in verified static code structure.**
