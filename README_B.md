# CODE Sherpa  
## Round-1 Implementation Summary & Round-2 Improvement Plan

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document outlines:
- What was **actually implemented and delivered in Round-1**
- What will be **extended and improved in Round-2**

The intent is to clearly communicate execution progress and planned evolution, without overstating features or scope.

## Project Recap

CODE Sherpa is a developer-onboarding tool that helps developers understand unfamiliar codebases through a **guided learning experience**.

Rather than relying on documentation, guesswork, or ad-hoc exploration, CODE Sherpa:
- Extracts **verified structural facts** directly from the codebase
- Converts these facts into **step-by-step guided explanations**
- Generates a **visual flowchart** that presents the repository as a coherent system

The goal is to help developers form an accurate mental model of a project before modifying or extending it.

## Round-1 Implementation Summary

For the first round of the hackathon, we implemented a **fully working end-to-end prototype** that demonstrates how a codebase can be automatically analyzed and explained using deterministic static analysis.

### Round-1 Capabilities

In Round-1, CODE Sherpa can:
- Analyze a real repository to extract verified structural facts
- Identify important files, functions, and call relationships
- Convert this structure into a step-by-step guided explanation
- Generate a flowchart that visually represents overall code flow and dependencies

### Round-1 Outputs

When executed, Round-1 produces:
1. **`demo/analysis.json`** - Complete code structure analysis
2. **`demo/learning_order.json`** - Structured learning path
3. **`demo/flowchart.md`** - Visual dependency graph (Mermaid format)

### Round-1 Technical Approach

The Round-1 implementation prioritizes **correctness, clarity, and reproducibility**:
- Uses Python's AST module for deterministic code parsing
- Template-based explanations ensure accuracy
- No external dependencies (pure Python standard library)
- Reproducible results (same repository = same analysis)

This establishes a strong and defensible technical foundation for further enhancements in Round-2.

## Key Differences Between Round-1 and Round-2

| Aspect | Round-1 (Current) | Round-2 (Planned) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Code Analysis** | Static analysis using AST | Extended static analysis |
| **Explanations** | Template-based, rule-driven | AI-assisted (grounded in verified structure) |
| **User Interface** | CLI-based execution | VS Code extension with interactive tours |
| **Output** | JSON files, Mermaid flowchart | Editor-integrated guided tours |
| **Code Highlighting** | Not available | Line-level highlighting in VS Code |
| **Comprehension Checks** | Not included | Short questions to reinforce understanding |
| **AI Usage** | Not used | Introduced after fact extraction |

### Key Principle

**Intelligence is added only after correctness is guaranteed.** Round-1 validates the foundation; Round-2 enhances the experience.

---

## Round-2 Implementation Plan

In Round-2, we will build upon the validated Round-1 foundation to improve intelligence, usability, and real-world developer experience.

### Planned Enhancements

- **AI-assisted explanations** - Generated only after verified code structure has been extracted
- **VS Code integration** - Guided tours directly inside the developer's editor
- **Automatic navigation** - Opens relevant files and highlights code sections
- **Comprehension questions** - Short questions to reinforce understanding
- **Enhanced visualizations** - Improved visuals and in-editor navigation

### Core Principle

All Round-2 enhancements extend the existing pipeline while preserving:

> **Every explanation must be grounded in verified static code structure.**

This ensures explanations remain accurate, reliable, and defensible.

## Summary

**Round-1 Achievement:**
- ✅ Working prototype with deterministic code understanding
- ✅ Complete pipeline from repository to explanations
- ✅ Reproducible results with no external dependencies

**Round-2 Vision:**
- 🚀 Enhanced intelligence through careful AI integration
- 🚀 Better user experience via VS Code integration
- 🚀 Interactive learning with comprehension checks

**Key Differentiator:**
The progression demonstrates a principled approach: establish correctness first, then add intelligence carefully.
